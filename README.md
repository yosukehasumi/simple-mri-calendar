# Project Name

Simple MRI Calendar - This is a one file plugin that you can use to create a bare-bones calendar for wordpress.

## Installation

Drop simple-mri-calendar into your plugins directory. I've included some example files from a previous site build to give you an idea how to output dates.
This plugin uses ACF so make sure you have that installed too.
NOTE: this is NOT a plug-and-play installation. I've just mearly copied the code from one of my projects to give you a starting point on how you might achieve a similiar custom-built-calendar

## Usage

in example.index.php you'll find simple_mri_calendar_filter(), simple_mri_calendar() functions being called and echoed. These would refer to your functions.php file. Examples of what they might contain can be found in example.functions.php.

NOTE: Make sure you look at your timezone settings carefully
